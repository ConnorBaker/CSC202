# DO NOT CHEAT.

I've created these programs for my own homework: I'm not putting them up so that others can steal something that I've spent time and effort on and pass it off as their own.

I'm putting them up so I can learn.

It is my hope that by sharing them with a larger community I can grow my knowledge of java through critique and practice.

Plus I missed using git.

# Note:

From assignment6 and onward, I decided to switch to using packages so I could have my main method in its own file. To compile these, you'll have center to the directory immediately above assignment# and do:

$ javac assignment#\*.java

$ java -classpath . assignment#.Main

Change the file separators as needed, depending on your operating system.
